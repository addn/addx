. addx is a  virtual system like java (the vm and the language);
it is composed of  addm (the virtual Machine),
adda (add`Automatica --the automation language),
and adde (the Editor -- a user interface and toolset) .

. addx is optimistically pronounced _addict's_ because something that was really useful and friendly would make you feel addicted to it;
conversely, it addresses the needs of those addicted to proprietary software
-- the endless cycle of buying more upgrades to find yet more bugs .

. there is no code at this time; just a blog .
